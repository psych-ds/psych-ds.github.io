heroSubtitle: A specification for organizing datasets in the social & behavioral sciences

# About section
aboutHeading: About
aboutText1: >
  Data sharing is important, but it can be hard to know how to do it well. When every scientist makes their own decisions about how to structure and share data, 
  it can be challenging and time-consuming to understand each others' datasets - or even our own work, six months from now!
aboutText2: >
  Psych-DS is a community data standard and technical specification that provides a systematic approach to organizing scientific datasets. 
  It is designed so you can make as few changes as possible to how you work with your datasets right now, in order to make it possible for you to share data exactly as you want to in the future. 
  Psych-DS provides tools for building and validating datasets, and works to create a consensus format that unlocks machine-readable data sharing for the social and behavioral sciences.
